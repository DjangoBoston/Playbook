# Title: February meetup, call for speakers, call for video help

## Welcome to 2015

Hey hey, Django Boston! Welcome to 2015! We've got a meetup scheduled for this month, and are planning the talks and events for the rest of the year. Come join us as we learn together!

## Thanks to John Roth and Max Nova

John Baldwin and I (Brian Dant) are stepping in as co-organizers for Max Nova and John Roth. Thanks John and Max for holding it together over the last 18 months or so! (If you have benefited from the contributions from Max and John, please send them a quick note thanking them: uhlenhuthm@gmail.com jroth.solar@gmail.com

## Upcoming Meetup: Feb 26th at Akamai

This month, Shankar Ambady from MassChallenge will be giving a talk on Natural Language Processing using [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and Django. This should be awesome! Shankar has given a talk to Boston Python on NLTK, and now he's adding Django to the mix. RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/220373782/).

We're still looking for a drink sponsor for the February meetup. If your company is interested in sponsoring, please let us know by responding to this email. Sponsorship will allow us all to go out for drinks together after the meetup, and gives you an opportunity to spread the word about your company and development team. Learn more about sponsorship here: http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/pages/Sponsoring_a_Django_Boston_Meetup/

## How Django Boston works

- Meetups happen on the 4th Thursday of the month (always at Akamai in Cambridge, unless otherwise noted)
- Pizza and salad is always provided (by Akamai)
- We often migrate to Mead Hall for drinks afterward (sponsored by another company)
- Everyone is welcome: beginners, experts, intermediate, not-sure-how-to-categorize-yourself. EVERYONE!

## Call for speakers

This is the part of the email that's supposed to pump you up about giving a talk. To do so, I'll give you a quick story from my childhood:

In kindergarten, my teacher asked me to give a talk on my favorite animal. I knew what it was (flying squirrel) so I was all like, "yeah, I got this." Well, as it happened, I got up to give the talk, and my mind went TOTALLY blank. It was the first time I had experienced this phenomenon, so I freaked out and ran back to my desk, but before I got there, I slipped on Lucy's Jello, flipped onto my back, and ripped out the seat of my pants. Sadly, nobody got to hear about the flying squirrel, and everybody laughed at me.

The moral of the story: No matter what happens during your talk, it can't be the worst talk ever, cause I own that. And your talk will likely be THE BEST ONE EVER.

But all jokes aside: we're all relying on the community as we make our living using freely available tools, and free knowledge generously shared by previous speakers. Please seriously consider helping the community by giving a talk (and making yourself look cool and seem smart, which you are!).

Of course, you can give a talk on any topic you want (it should be about Django, or at least something interesting for Django programmers). If you don't know what you want to give a talk on, there are many ideas below. If you don't know what to do, but feel the nudge to share your knowledge, respond to the email, and one of us will help you figure it out. You can also sign up for a lightning talk (5 - 10 minutes).

Alright, don't even think about closing the inbox, don't defer it, just respond and say "yes! I'll give a talk." :-)

Ideas on finding a talk:

1. Fork a talk

Many, many talks have been given in the past, so instead of starting from the ground up, you could "fork" somebody else's talk and save a bunch of time, while still bringing lots of benefit to us. With a simple email, it's likely that you could get the permission of the original author to use their slides, code, etc.

Search Django on pyvideo.org: http://pyvideo.org/search?models=videos.video&q=django

2. Get an idea / content for a talk from a blog post

The Django and Python world are full or really smart and generous people. Start with what they have written, and (ask first), and turn it into a talk. A good place to look is on the archives of popular newletters that aggregate Django and Python articles:

The "Django Round Up" by Lincoln Loop is excellent: http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=24fce4628ba1d5814debef334&id=2d6dd01daf
Python Weekly archives: http://www.pythonweekly.com/archive/
pycoder's archives: http://pycoders.com/archive/

3. If that doesn't work, here's a list of ideas that we recently created as "potential interesting talks"

- Django with Haystack/Elasticsearch
- Django and Docker
- Django and AngularJS
- Flask vs Django
- Getting a dev environment set up with Django + Vagrant + Virtualbox
- Django for a (Rails / PHP / .NET / etc) programmer
- High Performance Django (a talk that uses the recent book by Lincoln Loop to discuss making Django fast)
- Testing in Django (Given many times. Never too many)
- What's up with security in Django? (what do I need to be worried about? What does Django take care of for me)
- Django Rest Framework
- The state of real-time applications with Django (what are my options?)
- Getting the most out of the Django ORM

4. Grab a friend, and give a talk together

Talks don't have to be one person. Two people can tag-team and bring double the power to share their knowledge.

5. Volunteer to give a talk, but ask for help

If you want to give a talk, but don't think you're ready, or have the full time, email us anyway, and we will try to find somebody more experienced to guide you.

6. Volunteer to help somebody prepare a talk

If you don't have enough time to give a full talk, but have good knowledge in something, let us know, and maybe somebody will do most of the leg-work while you guide them.

## Call for video help

If you have video equipment and skills, we would love to hear from you. You can help us live-stream the talks, and record them to upload to our channels, allowing the speakers contribution to live on FOREVER!

Here's to an excellent 2015!

Brian, John, and Nate
