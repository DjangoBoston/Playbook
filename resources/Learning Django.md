# Learning Django

## Beginners
It is important to understand that Django is a web framework used for easily developing web applications using the Python programming language.  While you don't have to be a Python expert to start using Django, a good understanding of Python will make your journey with Django much easier.

If you have little or no web development experience, we recommend you begin here:
1. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) for HTML and CSS basics.  There are good introductory Python courses here as well.
2. [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) to help you understand the basics of how HTTP works.  This is a little technical, so if your head starts to swim, come back to it periodically.
3. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) An entertaining introduction to programming with Python.
4. [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html) Hands down the best overall web development tutorial for beginners starting out with Python/Django.


## Intermediate/Advanced
For those who know enough to be dangerous in Python or have a couple of years experience in another programming language/framework.

1. [The Official Django Tutorial](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) Learn how to make a basic, reusable "Poll" app.
2. [Tango With Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/) A little older, but more comprehensive than the official tutorial.
3. [Go Django](https://godjango.com) A library of screencasts for doing different things with Django (limited access to non-paying users)


## Project Ideas
Most people when they get started learning development do a tutorial and go "now what?"  You really start to gain an understanding of a language/framework when you've started using it for different projects.  Here are some ideas:

1. A "Twitter" clone (popular tutorial project in the Ruby/Rails community)
2. A survey app (survey your friends' opinions on different things).  Learn about forms.
3. Your own personal RSS feed (paste in links to RSS feeds for News, read the news from your own page)  Learn about parsing XML and gathering content from another source.
